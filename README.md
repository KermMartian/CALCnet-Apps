Requirements
============
Each of these programs requires [Doors CS 7 or later](https://www.cemetech.net/dcs) to run. Simply install Doors CS, then either run these programs from the Doors CS desktop or (if you enable HomeRun) from the TI-OS homescreen.

Building
========
These programs have been tested with Brass. None has been tested with SPASM, but they should work more or less out-of-the-box. If they don't, feel free to PR this repository with the fixes.

Functionality
=============
Note that much of the functionality on the internet side (clipping webpages, connecting to IRC) is performed by the relevant gCn Hubs. Take a look at [the repository for gCn](https://github.com/KermMartian/gcn) to find the source for those hubs.
